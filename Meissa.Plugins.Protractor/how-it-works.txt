1. Install Node.js
2. In the Plugins folder you should have a folder- node_modules with Protractor installed and updated
npm install protractor
- navigate to protractor folder and execute:
webdriver-manager update

The conf.js file + all spec files are copied to a new temp folder.
The plugin edit the conf.js and adds a function with custom NUnit Jasmine reporter with a new temp folder for the results.
The passed results file for all other plugins is a file but here the Jasmine report plugin generate a folder instead of a file. Because of that we delete the file.
In order the plugin to be able to generate the results we copy node_modules_jasmin_reporters folder where the Jasmin NUnit reporter is installed.
To filter the tests for different subsets we edit the spec.js files with regex replace and change the tests with specific names - from it to fit (focused)
Only these tests will be executed.
